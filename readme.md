Orientation-ice-breaker
------------------------

Project Description:

This is a fun ice-breaker game to play at Gabelli Business School orientation. Firstly, let me explain the database for trivia questions I used. I use BeautifulSoup package to crawl Jeopardy questions and answers from the Internet and save it under a .txt file. 
Once the game officially starts, it will randomly select a student from the student pool and ask one question for each student to answer. Since the important part is participation, it doesn’t matter if the student’s answer is right or wrong. So there won’t be any points deducted or added for each question. The system will only remind you if your answer is right or wrong, and pass the chance to other student. Once every student in Gabelli School is finished, the system will end and save all the questions that have bee answered to a .csv file for documenting purpose.


Prerequisites:

python 3.6.0
BeautifulSoup

Installing:

You can install Beautiful Soup 4 with pip install beautifulsoup4.

In Debian and Ubuntu, Beautiful Soup is available as the python-bs4 package (for Python 2) or the python3-bs4 package (for Python 3). In Fedora it's available as the python-beautifulsoup4 package.

Beautiful Soup is licensed under the MIT license, so you can also download the tarball, drop the bs4/ directory into almost any Python application (or into your library path) and start using it immediately. (If you want to do this under Python 3, you will need to manually convert the code using 2to3.)

Beautiful Soup 4 works on both Python 2 (2.7+) and Python 3.

Running the tests:
